    description: "This trail connects the Cullen Park asphalt hike and bike (which runs from Hwy 6 at Patterson Rd to Cullen Park off of Saums Rd & Park View Dr) to the Bill Archer Bark Park. Notice the massive oak trees just west of the bark park. The trail crosses Groeschke Rd, so be careful since this is an unprotected crossing. This trail will be inundated when the Addicks Reservoir water level is above 98’. Parking is available at the west end of the Bill Archer Bark Park parking lot (near the restrooms), on the north side of Groeschke Rd, about 1/3 mile west of Hwy 6, and at the Cullen Park trail parking lot on the east side of Hwy 6 just north of Patterson Rd. There is a small ditch, usually with water, to cross if you enter from the southwest corner of the Bill Archer Park restrooms.",

    description: "This is an old roadbed, formerly known as Lamb Road. 0.83 miles due west from Eldridge to Langham Creek. Runs through some nice pine forest. You may see wood ducks in the winter time on Langham Creek. Also look for the old wooden bridge and concrete cattle guard over the north ditch. The concrete cattle guard is part of the Bear Creek to Langham Creek trail. Parking for one or two cars is available off of Eldridge Rd. 6/10ths of a mile south of Patterson Rd. This trail intersects the Bear Creek to Langham Creek and the Langham Creek to Woodcreek trails. ",
